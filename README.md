# APCSA_GUI_CMDline_Story
## Introduction
This project is an *interesting* project designed by me, Jiaming Wang, for a story project at my high school. If you are reading this markdown right now, the project has the basis, but is obviously not finished. I'm still reading all the documentations and tutorials to make this project run seemingly fine.

C# is too similar to Java.

```java
Screw you = new Screw(); 
```
