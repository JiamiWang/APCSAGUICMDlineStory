# APCSA_GUI_CMDline_Story
## Introduction
This project is an *interesting* project designed by me, Jiaming Wang, for a story project at my high school.
<br>
Being one of the few CS projects I made in Java, I'd like to admit - C# is too similar to Java, so the syntax is easy to get used to, but the same can't be said about the features with this programming language. Nesting classes is easier and more designed for Java. Delegate methods are not available in Java. The `ref` and `out` keywords are not available in Java. Java is also running in its own Virtual Machine, and not portable to other platforms. Despite that, this programming langauge is still used by so many companies still!
<br>
```java
// bruh
Story story = new MyStory(); 
```

## Notices
* If you are running this project on Replit, the background music will NOT work because these are Wave files.
* This project 
## Developer Notices
TODO: Explain to other people about how forking and creating their own story works with this project
TODO: Explain about upcoming leaderboard feature
but yeah.. a lot of TODOs, and might never even touch one of these
## Credits
* Ozzed is the composer of the 8-bit background music in this game. Go support them at https://www.ozzed.net
* My Computer Science teachers, both of them who are presently working at my local high school (CS class is kind of fun ngl)
* GitHub, for existing (in terms of me using it for Git, and also the place where I learned coding...by reading tons of random projects I find)
## My workflow
this entire project is cloned to my Chromebook (BlueJ, and command-line Git), Laptop (IntelliJ and GitHub integration included), and Replit (da built-in Git features, and sometimes needed to rebase because code is screwed up... unfortunately). Very very good work flow! üëç
