# APCSA_GUI_CMDline_Story
## Introduction
This project is an *interesting* project designed by me, Jiaming Wang, for a story project at my high school. If you are reading this markdown right now, the project has the basis, but is obviously not finished. I'm still reading all the documentations and tutorials to make this project run seemingly fine.

C# is too similar to Java.
<br>
```java
Screw you = new Screw(); 
```

## Developer Notices
TODO: Explain to other people about how forking and creating their own story works with this project
TODO: Explain about upcoming leaderboard feature
## My workflow
this entire project is cloned to my Chromebook (BlueJ, and command-line Git), Laptop (IntelliJ and GitHub integration included), and Replit (da built-in Git features, and sometimes needed to rebase because code is screwed up... unfortunately). Very very good work flow! üëç
